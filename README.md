🍰 React Dessert Cart Application

This project is a React-based dessert shopping cart system that allows users to browse available desserts, add selected items to a cart, manage quantities, and remove items in real time. The application uses JSON data as a local API to dynamically render product information while maintaining a smooth and interactive shopping experience.

The main focus of this project is to demonstrate cart logic implementation, dynamic UI updates, and user interaction handling in React.

🚀 Project Overview
The application displays a list of dessert products with their image, name, category, and price. Each product has an “Add to Cart” button which, when clicked:
Adds the selected item to the cart
Updates the cart count beside “Your Cart”
Creates a quantity control system (+ and - buttons)
Updates the total price for that product in real time
Hides the empty cart illustration once an item is added

Inside the cart section, users can:
Increase the quantity of an item
Decrease the quantity of an item
Remove an item completely using the cancel icon
See the cart automatically return to the empty state when all items are removed
All updates happen instantly without refreshing the page.
